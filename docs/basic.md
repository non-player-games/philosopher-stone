## Gameplays

Objectives:

* ~~Get certain philosophical points (victory points)~~
* Defeat others

Gameplay will involves two phases:

1. Build
2. Cast

### Build phase

In build phase, player can utilize the stone (Philosopher's stone) to combine elements to build stuff.

In example, player can combine fire and air elements to build "Fireball" spell.

> From here, develoeprs will need build a element construction table -- defining what elements build what.

Another example is player may combine earth and air to build armor (proposed formuala).

In short, having a element table is quite important for this phase.

### Cast phase

In this phase, player can use actions (such as casting spells or equipping equipments).

With actions, one action may counter other actions. (in example, Fireball loses to Water lance).

> In this phase, developers need to define action resolution order.
